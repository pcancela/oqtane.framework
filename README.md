# PoC - MySQL database support for Oqtane Framework

The main objective for the creation of this fork was to perform some kind of a proof of concept around the addition of cross platform database support to Oqtane Framework. The result of this effort can be seen at **[](https://github.com/pcancela/oqtane.framework/tree/oqtane-add-mysql)**

Oqtane is a Modular Application Framework. It leverages Blazor, an open source and cross-platform web UI framework for building single-page apps using .NET and C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.

Oqtane is being developed based on some fundamental principles which are outlined in the [Oqtane Philosophy](https://www.oqtane.org/Resources/Blog/PostId/538/oqtane-philosophy).

# Background
Oqtane was created by [Shaun Walker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaunbrucewalker/) and is inspired by the DotNetNuke web application framework. Initially created as a proof of concept, Oqtane is a native Blazor application written from the ground up using modern .NET Core technology. It is a modular application framework offering a fully dynamic page compositing model, multi-site support, designer friendly templates (skins), and extensibility via third party modules.
